# Goldline Alpaca

## Concept
I had to create a website for an alpaca company in Belgium.

## Requirements
- Introvideo.
- The option to add all the alpaca's and view them on the website.
- The option to see which ones you can buy.
- To look between both genders seperatly.
- To see details of the alpaca (age, family tree, ...).
- A display of their products in a shop.
- Showresults of the show-alpaca's.
- A gallery.
- Links to their Instagrampage.
- Simpel, rustique style.

## Endresult
All the requirements are met.
I made a database with all the alpaca's with their own details, photo's and showresults.
On the website itself you can easily flow from page to page. Everything is clear and easily retraceable.
The texts and photo's are from the owners of the website.
For the colors I chose to stay in the colors of their photo's; a bright light green and yellow to brown tints.
I wanted to add a fun mini "did you know?" question in the alpaca information page.
